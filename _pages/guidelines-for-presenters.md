# Guidelines for presenters

You're doing a presentation at Salt Lake City Developers, great! Congratulations.

To make your talk as successful as possible, here are some tips:

* __Know your audience__: decide what level of knowledge is necessary to
  appreciate your talk. It's OK if people have to know something in particular
  already, we'd just like to describe that so that people know what they are
  getting into.
* __Decide what you want people to learn__: you don't have to write a textbook.
  It's OK to just give people a taste of something.
* ___Make good slides__: make sure your text is readable. Generally, use fewer
  words (you don't need complete sentences on the slide), and use bigger text.
  Full-screen your slides, and stand eight feet away from your laptop: can you
  read the text? Can your friend who knows nothing about development read the
  text? Also, check out https://slides.com/
* __Code samples__: having actual code on the screen is good, but make sure it's
  readable: the rules for text go doubly for code. Use a large font, and use
  dark-on-light text. The code doesn't have to be complete, it can be snippets
  to highlight the point you are trying to make.
* __Practice__: run through your talk a few times, ideally with actual people
  listening. You will probably need more time than you think.
